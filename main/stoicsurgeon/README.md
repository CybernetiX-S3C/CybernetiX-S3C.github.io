# Stoic Surgeon

This website is dedicated to some research I have done regarding the Shadowbrokers leaks of the last year. I have found it very difficult to find detailed technical write-ups of these leaks, at least of the parts that interest me. 

Recently inspired by [a presentation at DerbyCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqw-T1YQKUQ) about the DanderSpritz framework, I decided that I would share the research I've been doing and will do regarding these leaks.

My research will be primarly focused on the Linux leak (their Linux kit) and the Operational leaks (how they work).
