## Kali Linux DB Update GUI
#  Written by John Modica @CybernetiX-S3C
 
Kali DB is a tool written in basic bash dialog. This tool was created to minimize and utilized a users interaction with their linux based OS. It is made to be downloaded and used to build Kali Linux in any device with any OS. Features include, an Keysign option, Update/Upgrade menu, a basic apt repair kit, metapackage install, and a menu to build either a full version of Kali or Kali Linux Eveything. I only reinvented the wheel. Most of the intergrated menu options came directly from the Kali Linux official tools subdirectory. [Tools.Kali.org](https://tools.kali.org)
